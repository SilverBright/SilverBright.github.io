This was a tough project.  After 6 + weeks, I finally got it completed.  It’s not perfect and there are some bugs to iron out, but I have something I can turn in. 

Some takeaways…

* I threw Bootstrap into my project before writing any real code.  Big mistake.  After a few false starts, I left bootstrap off.  Completely.  I’ll add it in another day.  Focus just on the code.  The beautification can come later.

* Devise & OAuth was easier to implement than I ever expected.  I highly recommend using Devise for your login/logout/registration needs.  https://github.com/plataformatec/devise

* The most difficult part was wrapping my head around how a join table works, and how to implement has_many through in my code.  In all honesty, I'm still struggling with visualizing this concept, so I installed a gem called 'rails-erd' that spits out a pdf of my table relationships.: https://voormedia.github.io/rails-erd/

* Taking breaks, sometimes for several days at a time, really helped.  Sometimes it helps to focus on other things and come back later.  Each time I returned to the project it started to make just a little more sense, until one day, what started as an insurmountable, impossible, scary, intimidating project, turned into a small wee thing I was finally able to tackle.  Time is a funny thing.


My project: Haunted, is an app where all users can list haunted locations, add reviews, and share with each other.  I meant to complete it by Halloween, but... oh well.  :P
