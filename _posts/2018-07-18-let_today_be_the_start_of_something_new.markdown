I discovered my passion for web development when my spouse was deployed to Iraq. 

I volunteered for the USAR Family Readiness Group providing a content-rich web log chronicling the events and activities of our unit for families desperate to stay informed during a long and difficult 16-month deployment. 

With a scrappy old desktop and some books on HTML & CSS For Dummies, I designed, launched, and ran my first ever web log, before blogs were even a thing. Before I knew it, my page had thousands of hits per day, and by the end of the mission, my page was featured on the local news. 

After redeployment, I retired the site, and returned to my full-time career as an established, successful Executive Assistant.  (The only pieces I saved from the site was a homecoming video and a visitor comments section).

That was over a decade ago, and one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. A dream and passion I never forgot.

Today, I follow that passion as a full-time student in the Full-Stack Web Development Program at Flatiron School, with a “Women Take Tech” Scholarship.

I am excited to be a part of this excellent program and can’t wait to see where my coding journey takes me.
