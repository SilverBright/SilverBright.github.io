This week I stumbled upon a video lecture about learning how to learn code on YouTube from learn.co: 

[Learning How To Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS0eCu-NKXE&ab_channel=Learn.co)

Learning *how* to learn is probably the most important skill to have as a new developer, but I didn't really appreciate it (or understood what it meant) when I started my first lesson.  

Like me, when you're new, you're super excited to get started and you just want to jump right in and go! go! go!

But as I began to make my way through the cirriculum...a funny thing happened to my brain.  It went something like this...

Boy this lab is H.A.R.D.  Am I doing this the right way?  I am doing *any* of this the right way?  I feel so stuck, and I only remember half of what I learned in my last lesson.  Can I Google?  Should I hit the "Ask A Question" button AGAIN?  What about the people on Slack?  Everyone is so much smarter than me.  How do I debug this?  What do these error codes mean?  Can StackOverflow help?  My brain hurts.  

And down the rabbit hole I went.  Or pit of dispair.  I guess they're kind of the same thing.

But, I digress.

Learning how to learn is like learning how to wrangle a thousand conflicting voices in my head and getting them all to hush and focus again, so I can flow from one lesson into the next. One step at a time.

Here are the top 10 takeways that really hit it home for me from the Learning How To Learn video:

1.	Follow the Syllabus (Curriculum).
2.	Debug: make ONE change, then get feedback from your program.
3.	Go for a walk.
4.	Go slow: my race, my pace.
5.	Keep it simple.
6.	Google it! Look for posts, blogs, and tutorials online to help you.
7.	Ask for help. (And keep asking for help.)
8.	Keep going, slow progress is better than none.
9.	When you feel like you’re not learning anything, look back to see how far you’ve come.
10.	Work hard, be nice, stay positive, and have faith everything will work out. 

Happy coding!
