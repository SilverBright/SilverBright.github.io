This is going to be a difficult post, and a journey to the swamp of despair.  Continue at your own risk.

This was a really tough project.  I must have had a dozen do-overs.  Stuck in a rut of thinking too big, I found I needed to back off (a lot) and start fresh (again) on something I could wrap my head around before building bigger things.  Something like a simple todo app. Which is what I’ve built out for my project.  Not where I wanted to be at this stage, but it’ll have to do. For this moment, this is what I can manage without throwing in the towel, which, in all honesty, I’ve come close to doing for the second time in my coding journey.  I even had a conversation with my spouse about implementing Plan B where I just go back to the career I had before, if I ever make it to graduation.  I had hit rock bottom.  I almost walked away.

BUT…

I still stuck with it even though I felt I was making absolutely no progress.  I persisted.  Even though I felt like a complete and utter failure with nothing to show for all my progress this past year. As I built out little tiny pieces of my project, I started making my way slowly out of the swamp.  I’m not completely out yet, but I’m in a better place than I was a week ago, or two weeks ago.  A month ago.  Baby steps.

So, I built a super simple todo app, with one attribute to hold the data.  No join tables, no User,  no login, no Oauth.  To the best of my understanding, the rest of the project requirements have been met.  

And that’s where I was at. Feeling pathetic. Feeling sorry for myself.  Feeling panicked that this is the best I have to show future employers.  I’ll be laughed right out of the interview.  A silly todo app?  No one will want to hire me.  I’m a fraud.

BUT THEN I REALIZED…

I can always build upon it.  I can always add more functionality to it later.  When things make more sense.  I can always learn more, and continue learning.  It may be a really slow process for me, but I can always move forward.  Even if it’s just tiny baby steps.  At my pace.  This is what kept me going and keeps me going now.  This is why I did not throw in the towel.  Every day I can learn just one tiny little thing and eventually it’ll add up.  A month from now, I’ll know even more!  Then next month, I’ll know ever MORE!  I’ve even lined up Udemy and Coursera lessons because I can still keep learning.  

In time, I can build more things!!  Lots of things!!!  I love learning and that will never stop.  I will never stop learning.  No one can stop me.  I’m on fire. I may have the perception that I’m always in last place (whether it’s true or not), but I CAN DO THIS!  I have what it takes to put the swamp of despair behind me.  And not look back.

One day I will have that shiny new developer career.  It may not be today, or tomorrow, or even next month, or this summer, but I will eventually get there.  

I can do this.  Nothing will stop me.
