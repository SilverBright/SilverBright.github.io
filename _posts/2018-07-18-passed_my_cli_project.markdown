I passed my CLI Project, and I never really thought I’d make it this far.  It wasn’t easy and I needed a lot of help.  But I know I can really do this.

The hardest part (aside from believing I could actually do this) was finding the right website to scrape (I went through several), then trying to scrape the right data, and getting the data to look right.

The second hardest part was writing the code to make it all work, which involved watching multiple videos many times over, playing with my code to see if I can get it all to work (having several nervous-breakdowns in the process), then, finally having an ugly, but working version to submit.

The third hardest part was not knowing where to start on refactoring my code after I had my review, but with some guidance and help, I was able to improve on it, and clean it up significantly. My scraper class alone was 71 lines, which I was able to reduce to just 31.

At last, my CLI was pretty and DRY.
